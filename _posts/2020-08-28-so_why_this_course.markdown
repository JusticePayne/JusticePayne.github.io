I've been asking myself that too lately, along with what did I get myself into lol. I've always been the "tech
kid" of my house, whether it was anything from restarting the router, teaching my mom how to copy and paste or to 
learning how to completly disassemble my notebook laptop down to the motherboard, RAM, hard drive and all, putting it 
back together as my mom held her breath praying it worked afterwords. When I had taken the Computer Information 
Systems class, I thought I was just taking a fun class with my bestfriend at the time but really it made me think about 
what I'd want to pursue. Although back then, I was sold and stuck on the idea of being a graphic designer but, being in a small town made it seem like that'd be impossible without being in an actual city. So, I just went with the flow, going where life took me. Fast forward from when I graduated high school in 2013, to now in the crazy 2020, I'm (hopefully) becoming a 
softwear engineer. I discovered Flatiron and the bootcamp prep course through a Tik Tok my brother had sent me, and was like "Hey, why not? it'll give me something to do. I used to do this stuff." So a-coding I went! It was honsetly pretty fun to come across things I forgot I knew, kind of like listening to that song you were obessed with years ago. The love for 
figuring out that one, teeny tiny typo in line 14, or to watch your line(s) of code that YOU made work came back. It went 
from a tik tok to a possiable career and a complete change to life that follows.
